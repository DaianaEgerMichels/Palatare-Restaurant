        "1 teaspoon of baking powder",

        "preparation": `In a deep dish mix the cooked rice, milk, beaten eggs, 
        Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese, parsley, chives and pepper and salt.
        Add the flour little by little until the mixture gives consistency. If necessary, use more flour.
         The dough must not become hard.
        Place the dough in the refrigerator, covered, for about 30 minutes. 
        Remove the dough and mix in the yeast.
        Heat the oil in a deep skillet. To find the exact temperature point of the oil, 
        test it with a matchstick. When lighting the oil will be at the ideal temperature.
        Lower the heat a little and add small spoonfuls of dough to fry. Let it fry on one 
        side and then turn it over to brown on the other.
        Take care that the stove flame does not overheat the oil. Drain the cupcakes onto 
        a paper towel-lined dam. Serve immediately.
        You can use leftover rice and even risotto, which is delicious. 
        Just be careful with salt and pepper as the risotto is already seasoned.`,
